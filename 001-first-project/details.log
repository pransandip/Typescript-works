In this example, we define a RandomImageGenerator class that takes an array of image URLs as input. The class has a method getRandomImage that returns a random image from the list of images.

We then create an instance of RandomImageGenerator and pass an array of image URLs to it.

We also get a reference to a div element with the ID image-container using document.getElementById and assign it to the imageContainer variable.

Finally, we create an updateImage function that generates a random image using generator.getRandomImage(), creates an img element, sets its src attribute to the generated image, clears the contents of imageContainer, and appends the image element to it.

We use setInterval to call the updateImage function every second, which will update the image in the imageContainer every second.
